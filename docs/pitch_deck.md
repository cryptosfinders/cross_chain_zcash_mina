# 6-slide Pitch Deck (content)

Slide 1: Title — Zcash ⇄ Mina Privacy Bridge (PoC)
Slide 2: Problem — Cross-chain transfers leak privacy; bridges compound the problem.
Slide 3: Solution — Edge execution + ZK proofs; use Mina recursion to verify deposits succinctly.
Slide 4: Demo flow — Zcash deposit -> watcher -> toy proof -> Mina verifies & mints wrapped.
Slide 5: Security — timelocks, challenge windows, relayer staking; threat model summary.
Slide 6: Roadmap & Ask — replace mocks with real SNARK/STARK, audits, mentor/resources.
